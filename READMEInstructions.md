Unable to Start XAMPP

Ensure Apache and MySQL are not blocked by a firewall or another application.

Check if ports 80 (Apache) and 3306 (MySQL) are in use by running:

netstat -ano | findstr :80
netstat -ano | findstr :3306

If another application is using these ports, either stop that process or change XAMPP's port settings.

Port 3000 is Already in Use

To kill a process running on port 3000, follow these steps:

Find the Process ID (PID) using the command:

netstat -ano | findstr :3000

This will return a line similar to:

TCP    0.0.0.0:3000             0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       12345

In this example, 12345 is the PID.

Kill the process using:

taskkill /PID 12345 /F

Replace 12345 with the actual PID you found.

After completing these steps, restart the server using node server.js.
